# GauGAN Photoshop Swatches
![Screenshot 2022-03-04 at 10 31 48](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33449313/156737500-ab9db8a0-98ae-4c31-a6b1-46c40cde8906.jpg)

[Nvidias GauGAN](http://gaugan.org/gaugan2/), lets you create landscapes and more with the help of segmentation maps. Those segmentation maps  have particular color associated with a material. For example the color #936e28 will let you draw Roads.

You can also upload segmentation maps as a PNG directly into the tool. These swatches you find here can be installed into Photoshop, to help you create segmentation maps directly from Photoshop. Even though not tested, they should also work fine in GIMP.

## Mystery Brushes
In the folder Mystery you can find around 150 additional brushes, those where used in previous versions of GauGAN, but they also seem to work even though they are not part of the UI. They include the following categories:
- Animal 
- Building
- Food
- Furniture
- Ground
- Houseware
- Material
- Plant
- Sport
- Street
- Textile
- Vehicle

I used the color overview, provided by the [GauGAN plugin for GIMP](https://github.com/prusnak/gimp-plugin-gaugan).

## Contribute 
If you find any additional colors, feel free to open a pull request, an issue or dm me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tlsaeger).

## Disclaimer
This is just a fun and experimental tool, that should help Creatives work with GauGAN. I'm in no way connected to Nvidia and for the use of GauGAN the Nvidia [terms and conditions](http://gaugan.org/gaugan2/term.txt) apply.
